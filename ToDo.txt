EXTRA DESIGN OPTION ELABORATION (up to 53 points)

Performance counters (up to 5):
I was thinking of implementing cache miss rates and branch mispredict rates/bubble insertion rates in hardware, and have them be accessible to the software. Use the opcode left over by RTI (if unused by Erik's LC3X) to make our own instruction to move into probably R7. Just add more hardware to do this, it shouldn't be terribly difficult to do.


4-Way Set Associative Cache (up to 7) -- Complete!!
Potentially going to pull a midterm 2 and just use two of the existing L2 caches and connect them using some mediating logic. It should be fairly simple, though I think it'll end up adding a decent delay. Reference midterm 2 for design.


Hardware Prefetch (up to 15):
Would have to implement prefetching at the cache system level, as no new cache instructions may be taken during the prefetch. This would happen in the logic of the arbiter, as it would generate the needed address that would come after the L1 requests. Patch in branch predictions potentially? I.E. you hit a branch you've taken before and send to check if it's present in L2. That could be worth a point or two more depending on complexity.


Branch Prediction Suite (up to 21 points, depending on extent)
This is Jon's job. Godspeed to him. This involves a 4-way set associative branch table buffer (13) that support all control influences, meaning JSR, JSRR, TRAP and BRANCH (8). Technically speaking, they don't say it has to be good, but having the hardware influence things should be enough to get a decent amount of the points.


LC3X (up to 12): -- Currently debugging
Implement SUB, MULT, DIV, XOR, and OR. We're thinking these could be encoded into the RTI instruction in control. Unfortunately you need to prove performance improvement over software algorithms to achieve each of these instructions, which could prove to not be that much fun, especially considering that you need to modify the compiler (or add your own) that correctly understands the instructions in assembly. Potentially not TERRIBLE, but we'll see.




Questions for Dao:

How many points are typically expected from the groups as far as final features go? All 55? 40? 25?

Can you get full prefetch points if you don't prefetch anything for the data cache?

Does LC3X use half precision floating point or integers? (if it is integers, more points for floating point support?)
